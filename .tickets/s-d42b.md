# Custom importer: PolyUnity

Build custom career page scraper for PolyUnity (Webflow). URL: https://www.polyunity.com/work-with-us. DB company ID: 167. General 'join us' page without structured job listings - may not have parseable data.


## Notes

**2026-02-06T23:16:25Z**

PolyUnity actually uses BambooHR (found link to polyunity.bamboohr.com/careers). Added as BambooHR source instead of custom.
