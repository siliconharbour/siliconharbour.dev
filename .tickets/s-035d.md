# Fix stale edit form state in tinder review and add open-in-new-tab toggle

Approving/denying in tinder-style review with edit form open leaves previous entity fields in the edit panel for the next card. Reset edit form/state when moving to next item and make opening profile page in new tab toggle-able, default off.
