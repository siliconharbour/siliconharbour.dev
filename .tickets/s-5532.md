# Fix ICS feed Google Calendar compatibility

The calendar.ics feed uses floating local times (DTSTART:20260227T180000) without VTIMEZONE components or UTC offsets. Google Calendar requires either UTC times or proper TZID references with VTIMEZONE definitions. The ics library's 'local' output type produces floating times (RFC 5545 Form #1) which are ambiguous and ignored/misinterpreted by Google Calendar.
