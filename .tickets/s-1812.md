# Normalize public API response helpers

Introduce reusable API response/error serialization helpers and apply to api routes.


## Notes

**2026-02-08T01:58:02Z**

Extended /app/lib/api.server.ts with paginatedJsonResponse/apiError helpers and migrated API list + slug routes to shared pagination/not-found response patterns.
