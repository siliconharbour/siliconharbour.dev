# Job import blocklist for filtering unwanted jobs

Add ability to block specific imported jobs (e.g., sales roles) similar to how TechNL/Genesis import blocking works. Jobs should be visible on first import for review, but can be hidden/blocked so they don't display publicly and don't reappear on future syncs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Add 'hidden' or 'blocked' status to imported_jobs
- Admin UI shows new jobs for review
- Can mark jobs as hidden/blocked
- Hidden jobs don't show on company pages
- Blocked jobs stay blocked across syncs
