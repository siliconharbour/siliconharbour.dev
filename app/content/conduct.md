# Community Guidelines

siliconharbour.dev is a community resource for folks interested in tech and software in Newfoundland & Labrador. We want everyone to feel welcome and able to participate constructively.

## The Short Version

Don't be a jerk. Treat people with respect. If you wouldn't say it to someone's face at a meetup, don't say it here.

Comments that violate these guidelines will be removed, and repeat offenders may be blocked from participating.

## Guidelines for Comments

- **Be respectful.** Disagreement is fine; personal attacks are not.
- **Stay on topic.** Comments should be relevant to what's being discussed.
- **No harassment.** This includes offensive comments related to gender, gender identity, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, ethnicity, religion, or technology choices.
- **No spam or self-promotion.** Don't post ads, excessive links, or promotional content.
- **Be constructive.** It's fine to share frustrations, but if negativity is all you're offering, your comment may be removed.
- **Respect privacy.** Don't share personal information about others without their consent.

## What Happens If You Break the Rules

- Your comment gets removed.
- If it's bad enough, you may be blocked without warning.
- Repeat violations = permanent block.

## Reporting Issues

If you see something that violates these guidelines, use the "Send as private feedback" option when leaving a comment, or reach out to the site admins directly.

## Privacy Note

When you submit a comment, we collect your IP address and browser information. This is used solely for spam prevention and enforcing these guidelines. It's not shared with third parties and is only kept as long as needed for moderation.
