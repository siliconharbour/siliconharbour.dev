## Frequently Asked Questions

### Who is this for?

This site is primarily for **developers and builders** - people who write code, ship products, and make things. Software engineers, web developers, data scientists, DevOps folks, designers who code, and anyone else who spends their days solving technical problems.

It's less focused on the startup/founder ecosystem, enterprise companies, or students just getting started. Those folks are welcome here, but the focus is more on building software than pitching to investors or learning the basics.

### Why does this exist?

There's a lot happening in the Newfoundland & Labrador tech scene, but it can be hard to 'be in the know'.

Events are scattered across Meetup, LinkedIn, Discord, etc. New people moving to the area, or even people who have been here for a while but aren't as 'online', have no easy way to discover what's on the go.

This site aims to be that central hub - a single place to discover events, companies, groups, and people in our local tech community.

### Who built this?

This site was created by [Jack Harrhy](https://jackharrhy.dev/), a software developer based in St. John's.

While I'm the creator of this site, the goal isn't for me to be the forever [BDFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life), but I do think I'm well suited to launch it!

### Will this always be kept up to date?

That's the goal! The site is designed to be low-maintenance. It's actually built as a full web application rather than just a collection of markdown files or a WordPress site.

There's a bit of a bus factor on the site as it currently stands, but if it can function more like Wikipedia eventually, with some level of moderation / trusted admins, that should be less of an issue.

### How can I add my company/event/group?

Email us at <ObfuscatedEmail /> with the details you'd like listed. Include as much information as possible: name, description, website, logo, and any relevant links.

We do reserve the right to say *no*, as the intent is for the content to be of high quality. See if you can maybe find some PMF before submitting your B2B SaaS ChatGPT wrapper.

### How can I remove my listing?

Email us at <ObfuscatedEmail /> and we'll remove it promptly. No questions asked - we respect your privacy and preferences.

### Is this affiliated with TechNL, Genesis, or any other organization?

No, this is an independent community project. While we reference companies and such from directories like TechNL and Genesis Centre (with appropriate attribution), we're not officially affiliated with any organization.

### Is the site open source?

Yes! The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/siliconharbour/siliconharbour.dev). Contributions, bug reports, and feature suggestions are welcome.

### How is this funded?

Currently, this is a personal project with minimal hosting costs. There are no ads, sponsorships, or paid listings.

I think opening this up to having a *light* sponsorship system for curated relevant ads on the website, and inclusions in newsletters, is in the future of this website.

If you're part of a company that would be interested in this sort of thing in the future, reach out!

### Is this site vibe-coded?

By the [Andrej Karpathy](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383?lang=en) definition, *I don't think so*, but since its mostly just a CRUD application, and I didn't want to spend a ton of time on it, or a ton of time maintaining it, OpenCode and Claude Opus 4.5 were indeed the tools that authored this site, in the hands of someone who could have built it without those tools, but its 2026 and CRUD is solved.

The goal is for any textual copy / information / etc. on this website to however not at all AI generated, this is the part I hope will take the longest amount of time, curating content, ensuring quality and quantity!
