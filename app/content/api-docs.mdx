</Callout>

## Pagination

List endpoints support pagination:

- `limit` - Number of items (default: 20, max: 100)
- `offset` - Items to skip (default: 0)

Responses include a `pagination` object:

<CodeBlock>{`{
  "data": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "total": 42,
    "limit": 20,
    "offset": 0,
    "hasMore": true
  }
}`}</CodeBlock>

Responses also include [RFC 5988](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988) `Link` headers for navigation:

<CodeBlock>{`Link: <https://siliconharbour.dev/api/companies?limit=20&offset=20>; rel="next",
      <https://siliconharbour.dev/api/companies?limit=20&offset=0>; rel="first"`}</CodeBlock>
